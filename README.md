### 🧠 About Me

🎯 I’m currently enrolled in the **ALX Backend Engineering Program (Cohort 5)**, on a mission to **master backend development using Python and Django**.

💡 I’m passionate about building solutions that solve real-world problems—**one line of code at a time**. My long-term goal is to become a **Technical Product Manager** with hands-on backend experience.

🌍 I’m particularly interested in **Web3**, **HealthTech**, and **EdTech** innovations.

🛠️ I previously explored backend development using:
- `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript`
- `Node.js`, `Express.js`, and `MySQL`
